      "full": "The Chimera is a monstrous hybrid creature from Greek mythology, described as having the head and body of a lion, a second head of a goat protruding from its back, and a tail ending in a serpent's head or dragon. A fire-breathing female monster, the Chimera was the offspring of the giants Typhon and Echidna. She terrorized the region of Lycia until being slain by the hero Bellerophon, who rode the winged horse Pegasus. The Chimera has become the quintessential symbol of impossible hybrids and fantastical combinations, giving its name to the modern concept of 'chimera' - any impossible idea or hybrid creature. In genetics, chimerism refers to organisms containing cells with different DNA, named after this mythological beast."
